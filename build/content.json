I finished studying computer science at the University of Auckland in 2018, and since then I have been working with IAG where I have gained lots of experience working on web portals, being part of a scrum team, and also learning more about the insurance industry. I am always keen to learn something new, and I strive to find the best and most efficient ways of doing things, both at work and in my personal life. I think of myself as a people person and a team player, I have worked in teams where we love to have a laugh now and then, but are also driven and focused on the work. I have worked in retail jobs such as Zara where I improved my communication skills (and my patience). I enjoy photography and video making, I don't do it so often these days but I have worked on a few jobs such as weddings and promotional videos, and I believe that these skills along with my technical programming ability help me to have a good eye for front end development and styling websites. I have also been learning to speak Spanish since I finished university, and now I am at a high intermediate/advanced level. I cherish any chance to make a new connection with someone through language! I would love to continue onto learning other languages too but for now my goal is to achieve fluency in Spanish."
