                    <p>At IAG I have completed work on the AMI, State and NZI websites. I have improved my web development skills and had personal mentoring with all the relevent languages, especially javascript. It has also given me an understanding of the agile methodology along with the meetings and steps that are taken.</p>

                    <h3>Dec 2016 – July 2018</h3>
                    <p>At Zara, I worked with a big team of people. I often had to work to complete tasks as a group, and other times I worked independently, always to strict time targets. Quite often, I had to decide on my own how to complete a task in the most efficient way, or to organize and delegate jobs to others. I worked in almost every aspect of the store, from customer service on the shop floor, to unpacking and processing deliveries in the stockroom.</p>

                    <p>I tutored AS and IGCSE maths during my first year at university. This helped me with my organization skills as I had to prepare lessons for the students as well as following up after with feedback and helpful study material.</p>

                    <p>As a photographer for KJA I have worked at events such as weddings, balls and even New Zealand Fashion Week. At smaller events I have gone by myself to take the photos. At events like balls I have worked in a team of two or three. Although most jobs were for events, I also did some other types of photography like interior design.</p>
