                <p>I am currently working as a full stack developer for IAG, I have a particular passion for front end development and making a user's online experience as simple, efficient and enjoyable as possible. I finished studying computer science at the University of Auckland in 2018, and since then I have been working with IAG where I have gained lots of experience working on web portals, being part of a scrum team, and also learning more about the insurance industry. I am always keen to learn something new, and I strive to find the best and most efficient ways of doing things, both at work and in my personal life.

                I’m a very structured and organised person. I use a lot of to-do lists, and if a task can be made easier by writing down the steps to make a checklist, I’ll create one and use it each time. Or even better, if I can I will automate the task! I’d say one of my greatest strengths is being able to envision a goal, then break it down into steps and stick to my plan however long it takes until I’ve achieved it.

                A goal that I have been working towards for the last 2 years is fluency in Spanish. I have been learning it since I finished university, and now I am at a high intermediate level. I cherish any chance to make a new connection with someone through language! I would love to continue onto learning other languages too but for now my goal is to achieve fluency in Spanish.

                I think of myself as a people person and a team player, I have worked in teams where we love to have a laugh now and then, but are also driven and focused on the work. I have worked in retail jobs such as Zara where I improved my communication skills (and my patience), as well as Stonz Jewellers and the Clevedon market with my family. I enjoy photography and video making, I don't do it so often these days but I have worked on a few jobs such as weddings and promotional videos, and I believe that these skills along with my technical programming ability help me to have a good eye for front end development and styling websites.
