I finished studying computer science at the University of Auckland in 2018, and since then I have been working with IAG where I have gained lots of experience working on web portals, being part of a scrum team, and also learning more about the insurance industry. I am always keen to learn something new, and I strive to find the best and most efficient ways of doing things, both at work and in my personal life.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                I’m a very structured and organised person. I use a lot of to-do lists, and if a task can be made easier by writing down the steps to make a checklist, I’ll create one and use it each time. Or even better, if I can I will automate the task! I’d say one of my greatest strengths is being able to envision a goal, then break it down into steps and stick to my plan however long it takes until I’ve achieved it.  \n                </p>\n                <p>\n                A goal that I have been working towards for the last 2 years is fluency in Spanish. I have been learning it since I finished university, and now I am at a high intermediate level. I cherish any chance to make a new connection with someone through language! I would love to continue onto learning other languages too but for now my goal is to achieve fluency in Spanish.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                I think of myself as a people person and a team player, I have worked in teams where we love to have a laugh now and then, but are also driven and focused on the work. I have worked in retail jobs such as Zara where I improved my communication skills (and my patience), as well as Stonz Jewellers and the Clevedon market with my family. I enjoy photography and video making, I don't do it so often these days but I have worked on a few jobs such as weddings and promotional videos, and I believe that these skills along with my technical programming ability help me to have a good eye for front end development and styling websites.\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        )\n    }\n};\n\nexport default AboutPage;","import React from 'react';\n\nclass SkillsPage extends React.Component {\n\n    render () {\n        return (\n            <div className=\"skills\">\n                <h1>Skills</h1>\n\n                <h2>Technologies and programming languages</h2>\n                \n                <div className=\"text-group\">\n                    <h3>React</h3>\n                    <p>I have been learning React in my personal development time by working through courses on udemy and creating my own projects outside of work.

I also began working with a friend of mine for KJA Photography where I got experience being a photographer for different events such as corporate parties, weddings, balls, and I even did photography at NZ fashion week. In more recent years I have also enjoyed making videos for companies such as Daikin and the Middlemore foundation, which was great fun and I gained proficiency using adobe premiere and adobe audition. \n                    </p>\n\n                    <p>Some photography awards of mine:</p>\n                    <ul>\n                        <li>1st in AS Photography (2014)</li>\n                        <li>Young designer of the year award 2nd place (2014)</li>\n                        <li>1st= in A2 Photography (2015)</li>\n                        <li>Young designer of the year award 2nd place (2015)</li>\n                    </ul>\n                </div>\n                \n\n                <div className=\"text-group\">\n                    <h3>Agile</h3>\n                    <p>I work in a scrum team and use the agile methodology on a daily basis.

Quite often I had to decide on my own how to complete a task in the most efficient way, or to organize and delegate jobs to others.
