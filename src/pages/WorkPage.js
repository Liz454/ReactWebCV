                    <h3>July 2018 - Now</h3>
                    <p>I started working at IAG as a grad during my final semester of study. The team was really friendly and supportive as I learned about the technologies and processes that they use. I work on the quote and buy portals now, primarily doing front end work but as a team we all work on the different areas including the back end, analytics and databases. I have learned a lot about IAG as a business, the insurance industry, and also the agile methodology.</p>

                    <p>I worked with Daikin on their Healthy Homes competition to document the process of the home makeover, and tell the story of the winner. I took photos and filmed throughout the process, using adobe premiere and audition to put the final products together.</p>

                    <h3>Dec 2016 – July 2018</h3>
                    <p>At Zara, I worked with a big team of people. I often had to work to complete tasks as a group, other times I worked independently, always to strict time targets. Quite often I had to decide on my own how to complete a task in the most efficient way, or to organize and delegate jobs to others. I worked in almost every aspect of the store, from customer service on the shop floor, to unpacking and processing deliveries in the stockroom.</p>

                    <p>I tutored AS and IGCSE maths during my first year at university. This helped me with my organization skills as I had to prepare lessons for the students as well as following up after with feedback and helpful study material.</p>

                    <p>I worked as a Christmas sales assistant at Stonz Jewellers in the summer after my last year of highschool. During my time at Stonz I improved my communication and customer service skills a lot as it was my first retail job. I had to learn a lot of information about the product very quickly to be able to sell effectively.</p>

                    <p>New Zealand Fashion Week. At smaller events I would go by myself to take the photos, at events like balls I worked in a team of two or three. Most of the jobs were for events, but I also did a few other interesting things like interior design.</p>

                    <p>Over the years I have helped sell mandarins and avocados at the local farmers market with my family. We grow them at our family home, so I would sometimes help with the picking of fruit and separating them into bags, other times just helping on the day to sell at the stall.</p>
