                    <h3>July 2018 - Now</h3>
                    <p>I started working at IAG as a graduate during my final semester of study. I work on the quote and buy portals now, primarily doing front end work but as a team we all work on different areas including the back end, analytics and databases. While my scrum team worked on the Home and Contents websites during the year of 2020, sales increased by 72%, with an increase in conversion rate of 100% for the State house site, and an increase in conversion rate of 200% for the AMI house site. Throughout my time working at IAG I have done a re-skin on each of the 4 projects that my team worked on (home, contents and car for both the AMI and State brands). We also work with analytics systems such as Tealeaf, VWO, and Grafana.</p><p>
At IAG I was part of the social club during 2019 where we planned events and activities for the digital team. I also worked with new graduates and starters helping them get up to speed.</p>

                    <p>I worked with Daikin on their Healthy Homes competition to document the process of the home makeover, and tell the story of the winner. I took photos and filmed throughout the process, using adobe premiere and audition to put the final products together.</p>

                    <p>I worked with the Middlemore foundation creating video content to be used in social media. I worked with a colleague to create a set of videos that told the story of a girl that had to go through years of hospital treatment.</p>

                    <h3>Dec 2016 – July 2018</h3>
                    <p>At Zara, I worked with a big team of people. I often had to work to complete tasks as a group, other times I worked independently, always to strict time targets. Quite often I had to decide on my own how to complete a task in the most efficient way, or to organize and delegate jobs to others. I worked in almost every aspect of the store, from customer service on the shop floor, to unpacking and processing deliveries in the stockroom.</p>

                    <p>I tutored AS and IGCSE maths during my first year at university. This helped me with my organization skills as I had to prepare lessons for the students as well as following up after with feedback and helpful study material.</p>

                    <p>New Zealand Fashion Week. At smaller events I would go by myself to take the photos, at events like balls I worked in a team of two or three. Most of the jobs were for events, but I also did a few other interesting things like interior design.</p>
