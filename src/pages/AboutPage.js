                <p>I am currently working as a full stack developer for IAG, I have a particular passion for front end development and making a user's online experience as simple, efficient and enjoyable as possible. 
                </p>
                <p>I finished studying computer science at the University of Auckland in 2018, and since then I have been working with IAG where I have gained lots of experience working on web portals, being part of a scrum team, and also learning more about the insurance industry. I am always keen to learn something new, and I strive to find the best and most efficient ways of doing things, both at work and in my personal life.

                A goal that I have been working towards for the last 2 years is fluency in Spanish. I have been learning it since I finished university, and now I am at a high intermediate level. I cherish any chance to make a new connection with someone through language! I would love to continue onto learning other languages too but for now my goal is to achieve fluency in Spanish.

                I enjoy photography and video making, I don't do it so often these days but I have worked on a few jobs such as weddings and promotional videos, and I believe that these skills along with my technical programming ability help me to have a good eye for front end development and styling websites.
